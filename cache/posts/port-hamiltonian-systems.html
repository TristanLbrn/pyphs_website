<p>Denote <span class="math">\(E(t)\geq 0\)</span> the energy <em>stored</em> in an open physical system. If the system is conservative, its time variation <span class="math">\(\frac{\mathrm d \mathrm E}{\mathrm d t}(t)\)</span> reduces to <span class="math">\(\mathrm S(t)\)</span> the power <strong>received</strong> by the <em>sources</em> through the external ports. If the system includes dissipative phenomena, <span class="math">\(\mathrm D(t)\geq0\)</span> is the <em>dissipated</em> power, and the evolution of energy is governed by the following instantaneous <strong>power balance</strong>:</p>

<p>The port-Hamiltonian approach is used to decompose such open physical systems into (i) a set of components that are combined according to (ii) a conservative interconnection network. These two ingredients are detailed below.</p>
<div class="section" id="components">
<h2>1.1. Components</h2>
<p>The elementary components of multiphysical systems are sorted as (or can be a combination of):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(n_S\)</span> internal components that store energy <span class="math">\(\mathrm E \geq 0\)</span> (capacitor, inductor, spring, mass, heat capacity, etc.),</li>
<li><span class="math">\(n_D\)</span> internal components that dissipate power <span class="math">\(\mathrm D\geq 0\)</span> (resistor, diode, damper, etc.),</li>
<li><span class="math">\(n_P\)</span> external ports that convey power <span class="math">\(\mathrm S(\in \mathbb R)\)</span> from sources (current/voltage source, external force, imposed velocity/temperature, etc.), or any external system (active, dissipative, or mixed).</li>
</ul>
<p>The behavior of each component is described by a relation between two power variables: the <em>flux</em> <span class="math">\(f\)</span> and the <em>effort</em> <span class="math">\(e\)</span>, defined in <strong>receiver convention</strong> (the <em>received</em> power is <span class="math">\(\mathrm P=e\cdot f\)</span>, including for the sources).</p>
<div class="section" id="storage-components">
<h3>Storage components</h3>
<p>The energy <span class="math">\(\mathrm E_s\)</span> stored in storage component <span class="math">\(s\in [1,\,\cdots ,\,n_S]\)</span> is expressed as a <em>storage function</em> <span class="math">\(h_s\)</span> of an appropriate state <span class="math">\(x_s\)</span>: <span class="math">\(\mathrm E_s(t)=h_s(x_s(t))\geq 0\)</span>.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Example 1:</dt>
<dd>For a linear inductor with inductance <span class="math">\(L\)</span>, the state can be the magnetic flux <span class="math">\(x_L=\phi\)</span> and the positive definite function is <span class="math">\(h_L(\phi)=\phi^2/(2\,L)\)</span>.</dd>
<dt>Example 2:</dt>
<dd>For a nonlinear cubic spring with linear stiffness <span class="math">\(K\)</span> and nonlinearity coefficient <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>, the state can be the ellongation <span class="math">\(x_K=\ell\)</span> and the positive definite function is <span class="math">\(h_K(\ell)=\frac{K}{2}\ell^2\,(1 + \frac{\alpha}{2}\ell^2)\)</span>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Storage power variables (<span class="math">\(e_s\)</span>, <span class="math">\(f_s\)</span>) are related to the variation of the state <span class="math">\(\frac{\mathrm d x_s}{\mathrm dt}\)</span> and the gradient of the storage function <span class="math">\(h^\prime _s(x_s)\)</span>, the product of which is precisely the received power: <span class="math">\(e_s\,f_s=\frac{\mathrm d \mathrm E}{\mathrm d t}=h^\prime _s\,\frac{\mathrm d x_s}{\mathrm d t}\)</span>.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Example 1 (continued):</dt>
<dd>For the above linear inductor, these constitutive laws are the voltage (effort) <span class="math">\(e_L=V_L=\frac{\mathrm d \phi}{\mathrm d t}=\frac{\mathrm d x_L}{\mathrm d t}\)</span> and the current (flux) <span class="math">\(i_L=\frac{\phi}{L}=h^\prime_L\)</span>, the product of which <span class="math">\(P_{L}=V_L\,i_L\)</span> is the electrical power.</dd>
<dt>Example 2 (continued):</dt>
<dd>For the above nonlinear cubic spring, these constitutive laws are the velocity (flux) <span class="math">\(v_K=\frac{\mathrm d \ell}{\mathrm d t}=\frac{\mathrm d x_K}{\mathrm d t}\)</span> and the mechanical force (effort) <span class="math">\(F_K=K\,(\ell+\alpha\,\ell^3)=h^\prime_K\)</span>, the product of which <span class="math">\(P_{K}=F_K\,v_K\)</span> is the mechanical power (<em>i.e.</em> variation of mechanical work).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Finally, the total energy of a system with <span class="math">\(n_S\)</span> storage components is <span class="math">\(\mathrm E =\mathrm H(\mathbf x) = \sum_{i=1}^{N}h_i(x_i)\)</span>. The total storage function <span class="math">\(\mathrm H: \mathbb R^N \mapsto \mathbb R_{+}\)</span> is called the  <strong>Hamiltonian</strong> of the system. Then, the total energy variation of the system is <span class="math">\(P_{\mathrm{storage}}=\frac{\mathrm d E}{\mathrm d t} = \nabla \mathrm H \cdot \frac{\mathrm d \mathbf x}{\mathrm d t}= \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\partial h}{x_i}\,\frac{\mathrm d x_i}{\mathrm d t}\)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
Note the above definitions can be straightforwardly extended to account for storage components defined by a multivariate storage functions <span class="math">\(h_s(\mathbf x_s)\)</span> with state <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_s = (x_{s,1},\,\cdots,\, x_{s,n})^\intercal\)</span> and associated received power <span class="math">\(\mathrm P_s = \frac{\mathrm d h_s(\mathbf x_s)}{\mathrm d t} = \nabla h_s \cdot \frac{\mathrm d \mathbf x_s}{\mathrm d t}= \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial h_{s,i}}{x_{s,i}}\,\frac{\mathrm d x_{s,i}}{\mathrm d t}\)</span>.</blockquote>

<div class="section" id="dissipative-components">
<h3>Dissipative components</h3>
<p>The power <span class="math">\(D_d\)</span> instantaneously dissipated by the dissipative component <span class="math">\(d\in [1,\,\cdots,\,n_D]\)</span> is expressed with respect to an appropriate dissipation variable <span class="math">\(w_d\)</span>: <span class="math">\(D_d(t)\equiv D_d(w_d(t))\geq 0\)</span>. Typically, for a linear resistance <span class="math">\(R\)</span>, <span class="math">\(w_R\)</span> can be a current <span class="math">\(w_R=i_R\)</span> and <span class="math">\(D_R(i_R)=R\cdot i_R^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>As for storage components, a mapping of the dissipative power variables (<span class="math">\(v_d\)</span>, <span class="math">\(id\)</span>) is provided, based on the factorization <span class="math">\(D_d(w_d)=w_d\,z_d(w_d)\)</span>, introducing a dissipation function <span class="math">\(z_d\)</span>.
For the resistance, <span class="math">\(i_R=w_R\)</span> and <span class="math">\(V_R=R\,i_R=z_R(w_R)\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="source-components">
<h3>Source components</h3>
<p>The power instantaneously provided to the system through external port p∈[1⋯nP]
is Sp(t), and we arrange the source variables (vp,ip) in two vectors: one is considered as an input up, and the other as the associated output yp, so that the power received from sources on port p is Sp=yp⋅up=−vp⋅ip (receiver convention, with vp⋅ip
the power received by the sources).</p>

<div class="section" id="conservative-interconnection">
<h2>Conservative Interconnection</h2>
<p>The interconnection of the components is achieved by relating all the voltages and currents through the application of the Kirchhoff’s laws to the interconnection network (schematic). This defines a conservative interconnection, according to Tellegen’s theorem recalled below (see also [26] and [27] §9.4).
Theorem 1 (Tellegen). Consider an electronic circuit made of N edges defined in same convention (here receiver), with individual voltages v=(v1,⋯,vN)⊺
and currents in=(i1,⋯,iN)⊺ which comply with the Kirchhoff’s laws. Then
v⊺⋅i=0.
(2)
A direct consequence of (2) is that no power is created nor lost in the structure: v⊺⋅i=∑Ni=1Pn=0
, with Pn=vn⋅in the power received by edge n, thus defining a conservative interconnection (Tellegen’s theorem is a special case of a more general interconnection structure, namely, the Dirac structure (see [23] §2.1.2 for details)). Now, denote (vs,is), (vd,id), and (vp,ip) the sets of all the power variables associated with storage components, dissipative components, and sources (respectively), and v=(v⊺s,v⊺d,v⊺p)⊺, i=(i⊺s,i⊺d,i⊺p)⊺ the vectors of all the power variables. Then, Tellegen’s theorem restores the power balance (1) with
v⊺⋅i==v⊺s⋅is+v⊺d⋅id+v⊺p⋅ip∇H⊺(x)⋅dxdtdEdt+z(w)⊺⋅wD−u⊺⋅yS,
(3)
where ∇H:RnS→RnS denotes the gradient of the total energy E=H(x)=∑nSs=1hs(xs) with respect to (w.r.t.) the vector of the states [x]s=xs, and function z:RnD→RnD denotes the collection of functions zd w.r.t. the vector w∈RnD of [w]d=wd so that z(w)⊺⋅w=∑nDd=1Dd(wd)
is the total dissipated power.
The above description of storage components, dissipative components, and source, along with the conservative interconnection stated by the Kirchhoff’s laws, constitute the minimal definition of a port-Hamiltonian system (PHS) (see [23] §2.2). In this work, we focus on circuits that admit an explicit realization of PHS, for which the quantities b=(b1,⋯,bN)⊺=(dxdt,w,−y)⊺
(with bn=vn or bn=in) can be expressed as linear combinations of the remaining N powers variables organized in the dual vector a=(a1,⋯,aN)⊺=(∇H(x),z(w),u)⊺ (with an=in if bn=vn or an=vn if bn=in):
b=J⋅a.
(4)
Then, a⊺⋅b=a⊺⋅J⋅a=0
from Tellegen’s theorem, so that the matrix J is necessarily skew-symmetric (J⊺=−J). More precisely, we consider the following algebraic-differential system of equations
⎛⎝⎜⎜dxdtw−y⎞⎠⎟⎟b=⎛⎝⎜⎜JxK⊺Gx⊺−KJwGw⊺−Gx−GwJy⎞⎠⎟⎟J⋅⎛⎝⎜⎜∇H(x)z(w)u⎞⎠⎟⎟a,

where matrices Jx, Jw, Jy are skew-symmetric. The significance of the structure matrices is the following:</p>

<p>The PHS (5) fulfills the definition of passivity (e.g., [16]) according to the following property.
Property 1 (Power Balance). The variation of the total energy E=H(x)
of a system governed by (5) is given by (1), with D=z(w)⊺⋅w≥0 the total dissipated power, and S=u⊺⋅y
the total power incoming on external ports.
Proof.  We have a⊺⋅b=dEdt+D−S
. Now a⊺⋅b=a⊺⋅J⋅a=0 since J
is skew-symmetric. ☐
Remark 1 (Power variables). This work is devoted to the treatment of electronic circuits for which power variables are chosen as current and voltage. However, all the aforementioned definitions apply equally to multiphysical systems, provided an adapted set of power variables, generically denoted by flux (currents, velocities, magnetic flux variations) and efforts (voltages, forces, magnetomotive force), the product of which is a power (see [23] Table 1.1). This follows the bond-graph modeling approach [28,29], on which the PHS formalism is built (see [23] §1.6 and 2.1). The treatment of multiphysical audio systems in the PHS formalism can be found in [30] (electromechanical piano that includes mechanical, electrical, and magnetic phenomena) and [31] (§III.B) (modulated air flow for musical acoustics applications that includes mechanical and acoustical phenomena).</p>
<p>## 1.2. Example
Consider the resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) circuit in Figure 1, with nS=2
, nD=1, and nP=2, described as follows. For the linear inductance L, the state and the positive definite function can be the magnetic flux x1=ϕ and h1(ϕ)=ϕ2/(2L), so that vL=dh1/dx1 and iL=dx1dt. For the capacitance and the resitance, quantities are defined with x2=q and w=[iR]. Port variables are arranged as input u=[v1,v2]⊺ and output y=[−i1,−i2]⊺
(edges receiver convention).

Figure 1. Resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) circuit (notations and orientations).
Applying Kirchhoff’s laws to this simple serial circuit yields
⎛⎝⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜vLiCiRi1i2⎞⎠⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟=⎛⎝⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜0+1+1+1−1−10000−10000−10000+10000⎞⎠⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⋅⎛⎝⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜iLvCvRv1v2⎞⎠⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟.
From the constitutive laws of components, this equation restores the form (5) exactly, block by block. It provides the algebraic-differential equations that govern the system with input u
and output y
.
This work aims at simulating such passive systems by firstly generating Equation (5) associated to a given circuit, and secondly by deriving its numerical version so that a discrete power balance is satisfied.
Remark 2 (Reduction). The system (5) can be reduced by decomposing function z
into its linear and nonlinear parts. See Appendix A for details.</p>
